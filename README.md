# 🟣 Hey, I'm Ar113s

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Researcher | 🟣 Purple Team Learner | 🎯 CTF Player

I work at the intersection of **breaking things** (Red Team) and **defending them** (Blue Team).  
Still early in my journey — but obsessed with learning how systems can be attacked, monitored, and protected.

---

## 🟣 What I Do
- 🎯 Play CTFs to sharpen real-world attack/defense skills  
- 🛠️ Build small automation tools in Python  
- 🧩 Practice enumeration, exploitation, and detection  
- 🐧 Experiment in Linux-based home labs  
- 🔍 Study attacker behavior & defensive strategies  

---

## 🧠 Skills I’m Growing
- **Python** → automation, tools, recon scripts  
- **Linux** → CLI, system internals, troubleshooting  
- **Cybersecurity** → attacks, defenses, threat intel  
- **Purple Team Mindset** → build + break + fix  

Still a learner — but a consistent one.

## 🕹️ CTF Experience
I actively play CTFs to train like real attackers:
- Enumeration challenges  
- Web exploitation  
- Crypto basics  
- Forensics  
- OSINT hunts  

Every challenge teaches me something new.
